# Storm Damage on Urban Areas - Fire Department Amsterdam-Amstelland

This is the project GitHub repository for the Data Systems Project: Storm Damage on Urban Areas - Fire Department Amsterdam-Amstelland.
This project originated from a collaboration with the Amsterdam-Amstelland Fire Department, aiming to enhance their understanding of high-risk areas during storms. Their goal is to optimize the allocation of their limited human resources and equipment, ensuring timely and efficient deployment during storm-related incidents. To accomplish this objective, our task involves integrating diverse data sources and developing a risk assessment model. The outcomes of this model will enable the visualization of these risk areas, potentially through methods such as grid systems, district mapping, and more.
